# CS Club Quick Challenges

Welcome to the CS Club Quick Challenges competition! This repository contains a series of programming challenges designed to test your problem-solving skills, algorithmic thinking, and coding abilities.

## Competition Overview

These challenges are designed to be solved within a limited timeframe. Each challenge focuses on a specific programming concept or algorithm, allowing you to showcase your skills in various areas of computer science.

## Rules

- **NO AI TOOLS ALLOWED**: The use of AI coding assistants (such as GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT, Claude, or similar tools) is strictly prohibited. All code must be written entirely by you.
- Work individually on the challenges unless otherwise specified.
- You may use standard libraries included in Python.
- Internet access is limited to documentation only (no searching for solutions).
- Time limits will be enforced for each challenge.

## Challenge Format

Each challenge will include:
- Problem description
- Input/output specifications
- Constraints and edge cases
- Example test cases

## Required Dependencies

The challenges make use of the following Python packages:
- pytest (for running test cases)
- timeout-decorator (for enforcing time limits on solutions)

## Submission Guidelines

1. Fork this repository
2. Create a virtual environment
3. Implement your solutions in the designated files
4. Make sure your code passes all provided test cases
5. Submit your solution before the time limit expires

## Evaluation Criteria

Solutions will be evaluated based on:
- Correctness (passes all test cases)
- Adherence to the competition rules

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Read the challenge description in each folder
4. Implement your solution and test it with the provided test cases
